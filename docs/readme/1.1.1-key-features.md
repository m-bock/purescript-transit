### Key Features

- **Type-safe state transitions** - The compiler ensures all transitions are valid and complete
- **Automatic diagram generation** - Generate state diagrams and transition tables directly from your specification
- **Graph analysis** - Convert your state machine into a graph data structure for advanced analysis

> If you're familiar with [Servant](https://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/) from Haskell, **Transit** follows a similar philosophy: just as Servant uses a REST API type-level specification to generate type-safe routing functions and OpenAPI documentation, **Transit** uses a state machine graph type-level specification to generate type-safe update functions and state diagrams.
