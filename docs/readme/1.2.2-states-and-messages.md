### States and Messages

To represent our door in code, we need two things: the states the door can be in, and the actions that can change those states. In PureScript, we define these as simple data types:

<!-- PD_START:purs
filePath: test/Examples/SimpleDoor.purs
pick:
  - State
  - Msg
-->

```purescript
data State = DoorOpen | DoorClosed

data Msg = Close | Open
```

<p align="right"><sup>🗎 <a href="test/Examples/SimpleDoor.purs#L27-L29">test/Examples/SimpleDoor.purs L27-L29</a></sup></p>
<!-- PD_END -->

The `State` type captures the two possible states we saw in the diagram: `DoorOpen` and `DoorClosed`. The `Msg` type represents the two actions: `Close` and `Open`. These correspond directly to what we visualized earlier—each state and each transition from the diagram has a corresponding value in these types.

With these types in place, we can now implement the logic that handles state transitions. Let's first look at the traditional approach, then see how **Transit** improves upon it.
