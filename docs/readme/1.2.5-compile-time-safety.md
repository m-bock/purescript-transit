### Compile-Time Safety

The type system ensures that your implementation matches the specification. The following will **not** compile:

- 🔴 Missing a match line for a state transition
- 🔴 Matching on illegal state/message combinations
- 🔴 Returning illegal states
- 🔴 Misspelled names of states and messages

Conversely, the compiler guarantees:

- 🟢 All matches are covered
- 🟢 Each match is on the correct state/message combination
- 🟢 Each match returns the correct state
- 🟢 All symbols (type-level strings) are spelled correctly

Later we'll see how to generate the state diagram directly from the spec, ensuring it always stays in sync with the code.
