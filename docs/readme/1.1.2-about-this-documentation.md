### About This Documentation

All code examples in this documentation are extracted from actual, type-checked PureScript source files. Also, whenever you find an assertion or a full unit test, it's ensured that it ran and passed. In this sense this text is not just documentation, but also a test suite. At the bottom of every code example you can find a link to the actual source file. So you can get a better picture of the context and get information about the imports used.
