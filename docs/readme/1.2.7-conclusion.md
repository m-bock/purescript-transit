### Conclusion

In this example, we've seen how **Transit** helps you build type-safe state machines. We started with a simple door that can be open or closed, and learned the core workflow:

1. **Define the state machine** using **Transit**'s type-level DSL specification
2. **Implement the update function** using `mkUpdateGeneric` with `match` clauses that the compiler verifies against the specification
3. **Generate documentation** automatically—both state diagrams and transition tables—from the same specification

The key advantage is that your specification, implementation, and documentation all stay in sync because they share the same source of truth. The compiler ensures your code matches your specification, and your documentation is generated directly from it.

While this example was simple, it demonstrates **Transit**'s fundamental approach. In the next example, we'll see how **Transit** handles more complex scenarios with states that contain data and conditional transitions.
