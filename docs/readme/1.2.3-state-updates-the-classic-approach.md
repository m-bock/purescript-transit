### State updates: The Classic Approach

The traditional way to implement state transitions is to write an update function that takes a state and a message and returns a new state:

<!-- PD_START:purs
filePath: test/Examples/SimpleDoor.purs
pick:
  - updateClassic
-->

```purescript
updateClassic :: State -> Msg -> State
updateClassic state msg = case state, msg of
  DoorOpen, Close -> DoorClosed
  DoorClosed, Open -> DoorOpen
  _, _ -> state
```

<!-- PD_END -->

While this approach works, it has some drawbacks:

- The state diagram and implementation can easily get out of sync
- The compiler won't catch missing transitions or invalid state/message combinations
- You need to manually ensure all cases are handled correctly
