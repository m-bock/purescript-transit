### Generate Transition Tables

In addition to state diagrams, you can also generate transition tables from the same graph data structure. This provides a tabular view of all state transitions, which can be easier to read for some use cases.

The process is identical to generating state diagrams—you use `reflectType` to convert your DSL specification, but then use `TransitTable.writeToFile` instead:

<!-- PD_START:purs
filePath: test/Examples/SimpleDoor.purs
pick:
  - generateTransitionTable
-->

```purescript
generateTransitionTable :: Effect Unit
generateTransitionTable = do
  let
    transit = reflectType (Proxy @SimpleDoorTransit)

  TransitTable.writeToFile "graphs/simple-door.html" transit identity
```

<!-- PD_END -->

This generates an HTML file containing a table with columns for "From State", "Message", and "To State". The table can be embedded directly in documentation (as shown in the examples above) or viewed in a browser.

Since both the state diagram and transition table are generated from the same DSL specification, they're guaranteed to be consistent with each other and with your type-level specification.
