## Example 1: A Simple Door

Let's start with a simple door state machine to demonstrate **Transit**'s core concepts. This example will show you how to define a state machine using **Transit**'s type-level DSL, implement a type-safe update function, and generate documentation automatically. We'll compare the traditional approach with **Transit**'s approach to highlight the benefits of compile-time safety and automatic documentation generation.
