### The State Machine

Here's the state diagram:

#### Transition Table

And here's the corresponding transition table:

<!-- PD_START:raw
filePath: graphs/simple-door.html
--><table><thead><tr><th>From State</th><th /><th>Transition</th><th /><th>To State</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DoorOpen</td><td>⟶</td><td>Close</td><td>⟶</td><td>DoorClosed</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>DoorClosed</td><td>⟶</td><td>Open</td><td>⟶</td><td>DoorOpen</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- PD_END -->

The diagram shows a simple state machine with two states (`DoorOpen` and `DoorClosed`) and two transitions (`Close` and `Open`). The arrows indicate the valid transitions: you can close an open door, and you can open a closed door. The table provides a tabular view of the same information, clearly showing all valid transitions in a structured format. Both the diagram and table are automatically generated from the same **Transit** specification, ensuring they always stay in sync with the code.

Now let's see how we represent this state machine in PureScript code. We start by defining the states and messages as simple data types:
